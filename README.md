# cub3D

## Summary

This project is inspired by the world-famous [Wolfenstein 3D game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D), which was the first FPS ever. It is a remarkable technique to explore, and a great opportunity to create a game with a good design and a nice user interface.

## Introduction

This project is an introduction to the Ray-Casting technology, and is the first step to creating a game within the framework of the 42 school. The main goal is to create a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you'll have to find your way.
