# cub3D

## Summary

This project is inspired by the world-famous [Wolfenstein 3D game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D), which was the first FPS ever. It is a remarkable technique to explore, and a great opportunity to create a game with a good design and a nice user interface.

Developed by [id Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Software) and published by [Apogee Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apogee_Software), Wolfenstein 3D was released in 1992. It was a revolutionary game that popularized the FPS genre and helped establish the PC as a gaming platform.

## Project Overview

The main objective of the cub3d project is to create a simple 3D maze game using raycasting techniques. You'll build a game engine from scratch that can render a 3D world from a first-person perspective, similar to early 3D games like Wolfenstein 3D.
